# Sample Utterance Generator

## What:

The tool introduces an easy to generate multiple sample utterance values with just a few comma separated  words.  
  

## Why use this tool:

-   Provide more consistency and variety in your sample utterance collection by defining their grammar rather than writing down one by one.
-   Don't care about duplicates and overlaps in utterances and slot values as this tool eliminates them.
  

### Here is a classic Example

**Intent Name:**  BookingCarIntent  
**Purpose:**  Use this set to train the model to book a cab in any way you ask.  
  
Sample utterances can be:  

Get me a cab  
Book us a cab  
Get me car  
Book me a vehicle  
.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
The list goes onâ€¦..

From the above video, doing a simple math the above line can generate 2*4*2*2*4 = 128 unique dialogues. (Here we consider blank space even as they are also part of the generated utterances).
